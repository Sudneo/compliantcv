## CompliantCV

This typst CV template is heavily inspired by https://github.com/jskherman/imprecv/tree/main, with substantial modifications.

- The layout has been modified to make it more colorful.
- Some sections have been removed
- Most notably, the configuration has been moved from YAML to TOML, and the configuration is now compliant with the [JSONResume](https://jsonresume.org/schema) schema

In fact, this template at the moment is designed to be the "pdf generator" for a static [zola](https://getzola.org) site.
